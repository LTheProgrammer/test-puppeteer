# Test project
I wanted to test Puppeteer and see how it would behave/perform at generating invoices pdf of variable length.

# How to use

-git clone  
-in git bash at something/js-pdf use the command 'npm run install-all' **  
-then 'npm run dev'  
-open your browser and go to localhost:5173  
-click the buttons, the pdf will be generated and downloaded once ready  

** If you have issue with the node module delete them, upgrade your node.js version, restart the computer and restart the install-all step.  
Node.js version used : v22.16
